# Path of economy

Tired of having to use a spreadsheet to register all the live searches I was doing on [pathofexile.com/trade](https://pathofexile.com/trade), I decided to create an application that plugs itself on the aforementionend site to retrieve your livesearch data and display it in an orderly and *searchable* fashion.
On top of having a nice display and not forcing you to enter your livesearches in a spreadsheet by yourself, it adds features like: 


- Filter your searches by a number of parameters (item name, item type, corrupted items, you name it)
- Allows you to add comments to your livesearches
- Your livesearches are scoped by League. If no livesearch was made for the current league, it will display your livesearch from the previous league, with an "outdated" indicator.
